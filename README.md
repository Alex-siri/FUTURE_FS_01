## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

### 1. Start the Backend Server
The project uses a local Express server to handle contact form submissions.
```bash
cd backend
npm install
node index.js
```
*Note: The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.*

### 2. View the Frontend
Open `index.html` in your browser. For the development experience, it is highly recommended to use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.

## 📬 Contact Form Configuration
If you need to change your email or re-authenticate in the future:
1. Ensure 2-Step Verification is on for your Google Account.
2. Go to `https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords` and generate a new **App Password**.
3. Place the 16-character password into `backend/index.js` inside the `transporter` auth object.
